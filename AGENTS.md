# Engineering principles

1. Every line of code should justify its existence. Define once; reuse everywhere.
2. Keep the site static and accessible. Prefer HTML/CSS/vanilla JS. Add dependencies only when a real requirement justifies them.
3. Four editorial categories only: postgraduate exam, overseas study, employment, civil service/public institutions. Experiences include guidance; do not create a separate guide category.
4. `data/schema.json` owns category labels and submission fields. Never duplicate category definitions in multiple scripts. Article titles are derived from author, destination, and optional program; do not request a redundant title from contributors.
5. No invented student stories, admission results, testimonials, or counts.
6. No hidden submission side effects. Never claim a submission succeeded until the backend confirms it.
7. Public GitHub Issues expose submitted content including optional contact details. Show a plain-language warning next to the form.
8. Use semantic markup, keyboard-accessible controls, responsive layouts, reduced-motion support, and readable contrast.
9. Browser previews and published pages must use consistent Markdown structures and the shared `.article-body` CSS; any parser differences must be documented rather than hidden. Changes should solve root causes, not accumulate patches. Commit coherent milestones directly to main during the initial build phase; PRs are not required.
10. The emergency-blue palette is a custom interpretation until official UEM visual identity color values are verified.

11. Use `assets/icons/favicon.svg` for all browser favicons, `assets/images/favicon-横版.png` for shared header branding, and `assets/images/anguo-garden.jpg` as a shared site background on all pages with distinct light/dark readability surfaces; paint the campus photo once on body; restore saved theme before stylesheet rendering with theme-init.js; share HAI-inspired footer navigation via site.js with a static fallback; retain transparent content and no decorative hero widgets. Keep image references consistent on root and generated article pages.

12. Public contributions use the ELPA-inspired trust boundary: Cloudflare Worker Turnstile → public GitHub Issue → maintainer Completed closure → GitHub Actions validation → Markdown → Pages. The browser contains no secret, publication is idempotent, and unavailable services must fail closed. Maintain one canonical schema at `data/schema.json` shared by the form, Worker, and importer.
